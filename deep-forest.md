# Deeper into the Forest

You follow the narrow path deeper into the forest. The canopy above thickens, blocking out most of the sunlight. Everything feels stillâ€”unnaturally still.

You spot a wooden hut partially hidden by vines, and in the distance, you hear the soft strumming of a harp.

What do you do?
